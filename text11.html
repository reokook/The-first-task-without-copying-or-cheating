<p>The equation for calculating the area of a square is: A = s ^ 2 where A is the area and s is the side length.
</p>
<p>The Pythagorean theorem is: a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = c ^ 2 where a and b are the legs of a right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse.
</p>
<p>The formula for compound interest is: A = P * (1 + r / n) ^ (nt) where A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.</p>
